# Traqix LowCode/NoCode Editor

![Editor Screenshot](./screenshot/traqix-rev0.PNG)

Traqix LowCode/NoCode Editor is a powerful tool for designing visual interfaces for systems and websites. Built on **Tailwind CSS** and using **ShadCN-UI** components, it simplifies the creation of layouts and components such as tables, charts, forms, and panels.

With a modern and intuitive interface, this editor allows developers to create responsive and interactive UI elements visually, while maintaining control over the Tailwind CSS classes. It also integrates with Vercelâ€™s **v0**, enabling the reuse of AI-generated components, allowing seamless import and manipulation of these components within the editor.

**Note:** This project is under active development and may contain bugs or unexpected behavior.
